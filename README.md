# 👋 Hi, I’m Adam

Product Director with a technical mindset. I lead teams building data-driven products used by global streaming and TV clients. I'm comfortable working across APIs, analytics, and UI/UX — and I document ideas clearly so teams can move fast.

### 🔍 What you’ll find here

- **Specs and Docs** – Examples of my product thinking, from one-pagers to Gate 0 business cases
- **API Work** – Mocked API specs and Postman collections I've worked with or reviewed
- **Analytics** – SQL examples used for GA4, Superset, and product adoption reporting

Most repos here are anonymised or illustrative versions of real work I’ve done — intended to show how I think, not to share company IP.
